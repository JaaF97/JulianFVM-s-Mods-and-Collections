Last Stand adds a chance for zombies to become stronger and faster when they are about to die, providing a last stand to try to survive.

## Description:
This mod is part of my mod [**Reactive Zombies**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969542746) (named Last Resort). I'm not updating it anymore, but I like this feature and decided to make it a standalone mod!.

## Mod Content & Mechanics:
If a zombie is about to die, there's a chance it becomes stronger and faster, as a last resort to try to survive. Everything below is configurable in the sandbox settings
- Zombies have a chance to enter **Last Stand** mode when at risk of dying;
- Base probability is 1%, but may be increased up to X%;
- Last Stand zombies emit a sound upon death, attracting other zombies within a X-tile radius (configurable in the sandbox settings)
- Probability increases if:
    - *Player Wounds:* Every unbandaged wound increases chance by X%, if it's bandaged, it's X%;
    - *Chasing Zombies:* If chased by 4 or less zombies, increase probability by X% per zombie;
    - *Player Weapon:* If the player hit the zombie with a ranged weapon, increase chance by X%;
    - *Player Health:* Increase chance by X% for every 25% HP the player loses;
- OPTIONAL: Other zombies have a chance to scream too (if you use another mod that does this, like [**Echoes of the Dead**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3025595058&searchtext=echoes+of+the+dead), disable this option)

- If you started a world with this mod enabled, and the mod updated, don't worry, it's **save compatible**.
