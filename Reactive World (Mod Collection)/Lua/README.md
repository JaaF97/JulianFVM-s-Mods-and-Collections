# Instructions:
- Launch Project Zomboid, go to MODS, and make sure you enabled [ModManager](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2694448564) (if you didn't, enable it, press "accept", and wait till the game reloads);
- Exit Project Zomboid;
- Navigate to C:\Users\%Username%\Zomboid\Lua (where %Username% is your username);
    - **If you don't have other modlists:** Place the .txt file here;
    - **If you have other modlists:** Open **saved_modlists.txt**, and paste the content of my file.
- Launch the game, go to MODS again, and you'll find a label named "Saved Presets". Click on it, select the modlist and click accept.

## REMINDER:
- If you have other modlists saved, don't paste the .txt file. Paste its content. Otherwise, you'll lose your saved modlists;
- saved_modlists.txt is also available in Discussions/saved_modlists.txt.
