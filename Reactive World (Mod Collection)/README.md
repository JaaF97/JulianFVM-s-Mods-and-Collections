# Reactive World: Mod Collection
![](https://i.ibb.co/nQtFqVF/Description.png)
Project Zomboid vanilla is great, but what if the world reacted to your actions? That is the goal of this collection. Create a world where zombies react to your actions, your character can evolve in certain aspects, and more!

Sandbox settings are almost all the same across all playthroughs. This collection handles this different in many ways. That's why I've divided these in 3 difficulties:
  
  - **Easy:** For new players. Multi-hit enabled, normal zombie count, zombies aren't that smart, normal loot. Rosewood would be a good place to start.
  
  - **Normal**: For casual players. Multi-hit enabled, higher zombie count, zombies have default settings, less loot. Similar to vanilla "apocalypse" mode.
 
  - **Hard:** This is the original preset. Multi-hit disabled, even higher zombie count, zombies are much more smarter, less vehicles, even less loot. Experienced players are going to enjoy this one, you're going to feel like when you started to play the game.

**Automatic Option:**
If you want everything to work well together, use [ModManager](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2694448564). Further down this description, the [i]saved_modlists.txt[/i] is there to be copied and pasted so you don't have to do it manually!.

Sandbox Settings and saved_modlist.txt are in GitHub. To add them to your game, follow these instructions:

  - **Sandbox Settings**
    - Navigate to C:\Users\%Username%\Zomboid\Sandbox Presets (where %Username% is your username);
    - Paste here the .cfg file available in GitHub (you can download all of them and check out which suits you).
  - **saved_modlists.txt**
    - Launch Project Zomboid, go to MODS, and make sure you enabled [ModManager](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2694448564) (if you didn't, enable it, press "back", and wait till the game reloads);
    - Exit Project Zomboid;
    - Navigate to C:\Users\%Username%\Zomboid\Lua (where %Username% is your username);
    - Place here the .cfg file avaiable in GitHub or...
    - Find **saved_modlists.txt**, open it, and paste the contents found in Discussions/saved_modlists.txt;
    - Launch the game, go to MODS again, and you'll find a label named "Saved Presets". Click on it, select the modlist and click accept;
    - You can make changes to mods that have optional modules (like level-up sounds and such, make sure you pick only one!).
