# Reactive World: Reactive Zombies
Zombie attributes and behavior change with your actions. Too aggressive? Zombies become stronger and tougher. Too passive? They get smarter. 

## Description:
After months of slaying zombie after zombie, you may feel like they're too weak, they don't respond to your actions, they're just walking/sprinting things wanting to eat your brain, but that's it. They won't change, their strength is the same at day 1 and day 365. If they are about to die, they behave the same as if nothing is happening. Well, time to change all that!.

This mod is part of my [**mod collection**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969507692), which goal is to make the world as reactive to your actions and playstyle as possible. Check it out!.

## Mod Content & Mechanics:
Zombie attributes and behavior are now dynamic. Long gone are the days where zombies were just the same on day 1 and after 6 months. First, let me explain what mechanics the mod use for zombie attributes and behavior to change with time:
- **Demolisher Mode:** If a player isn't seen by zombies in a day, make the zombies more destructive (these stats revert a stage if the player is seen by zombies again);
- **Last Resort:** If a zombie is about to die, there's a chance it becomes stronger and faster, as a last resort to try to survive.
    - Last Resort can happen if a hit zombie's HP is below 100;
    - Base probability is 1%;
    - Probability increases if:
        - *Chasing Zombies:* If chased by 3 or less zombies, increase probability by 1%-2%-3% as zombies chasing goes down to 1;
        - *Player Health:* Increase chance by 2% for every 25% HP the player loses (up to 6%, 75% max HP loss);
        - *Player Weapon:* If the player hit the zombie with a ranged weapon, increase chance by 2%;
        - *Player Wounds:* Every unbandaged wound increases chance by 3% (12% max), if it's bandaged, it's 1% (4% max).
- **Player Playstyle:**
    - Zombies can become stronger on a X:1 kills/days survived ratio (customizable in Sandbox Settings);
    - Zombies can become tougher on a X:1 kills/days survived ratio (customizable in Sandbox Settings).
- **Smartness**
    - Every X days, if you don't kill zombies, all their behavior attributes (found in Advanced Zombie Options) will evolve.
- **Time elapsed:**
    - If enabled, each day there's a probability that zombie fire resistance increases to a maximum (customizable in Sandbox Settings). Zombies take x4 damage to fire at the start of the game;
    - If enabled, each day there's a probability that zombie mortality increases, making zombification faster (customizable in Sandbox Settings);
- **Time of Day:** At night, zombies see less;
- **Weather:** Zombies may be more blind, slower and less perceptive during stormy, foggy, rainy and snowy days.

Every zombie attribute (strength, toughness, cognition, etc.) and behavior depends on these mechanics.

## Help! This doesn't work:
- Make sure you are subscribed and **ENABLED** my mod to my mod;
- If you started a world with this mod enabled, and the mod updated, don't worry, it's **save compatible**.

## Planned Features:
- **Add** save compatibility with already created saves; **DONE**
- **Add** a new mechanic: If a player is badly injured, nearby zombies become faster to try to kill him (AKA Forced Last Resort);
- **Add** compatibility with other mods. It's kind of hard to do this, as it requires to know what mods I should make this compatible with. Right now, this should work with most mods, but if a mod is similar to this one (changes zombies attributes or behavior), a patch isn't going to be possible.
