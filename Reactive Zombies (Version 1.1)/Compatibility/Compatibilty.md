    - Active Zombies (Singleplayer);    
    - Dynamic Traits and Expanded Moodles;
    - Slower Sprinters \ Joggers and Runners.
- Partly compatible with:
    - Fire Damage Rebalance (mod mechanic is somewhat implemented in my mod);
    - Night Sprinters (load after my mod, it won't be stable but it will work)
    - Under Cover of Darkness (mod mechanic is somewhat implemented in my mod);
    - Zombies Fear The Sun (should work fine, but not tested enough).
- Incompatible with:
    - Any mod that changes Zombie.Lore or Zombie.Config. Some can be compatible, make sure to always load my mod at the bottom if possible (using ModManager)
    - Customizable Zombies;
    - Personalized Zombies;
    - Random Zombies (this mod changes zombies attributes and updates them frequently, making my mod mechanics unstable at times, I don't recommend enabling both, but go ahead if you want);
