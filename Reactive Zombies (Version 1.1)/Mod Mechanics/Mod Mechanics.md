# Mod Mechanics
All zombie attributes and behavior can change. Every day, at 0am, the game checks the player stats and zombie stats. If they have to change (due to, for example, killing more than X zombies per day), it updates the zombies in your cell and every other zombie you're going to see will spawn with already buffed/nerfed stats.
- **ATTRIBUTES:**
    - **Strength:** Depends on player playstyle, and zombie Last Resort. If you set it to random, the mod won't change zombie strength;
    - **Toughness:** Depends on player playstyle. If you set it to random, the mod won't change zombie toughness;
    - **Cognition:** Depends on Demolisher Mode. Max cognition is Navigate (Navigate + doors could be implemented);
    - **Memory:** Depends on zombie smartness. If you're killing too many zombies, memory will improve each day. Else, it's random;
    - **Sight:** Affected by weather and time of day. If it's foggy, snowy or is night time, it's reduced;
    - **Hearing:** Affected by weather. If it's rainy, it's reduced;
