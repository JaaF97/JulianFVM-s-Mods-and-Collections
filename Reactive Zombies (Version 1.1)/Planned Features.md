# Planned Features for Reactive Zombies:

- **Add** save compatibility for created worlds; **DONE**
- **Add** a new mechanic: If a player is badly injured, nearby zombies become faster to try to kill him (AKA Forced Last Resort);
- **Add** compatibility with other mods. It's kind of hard to do this, as it requires to know what mods I should make this compatible with. Right now, this should work with most mods, but if a mod is similar to this one (changes zombies attributes or behavior), a patch isn't going to be possible.
