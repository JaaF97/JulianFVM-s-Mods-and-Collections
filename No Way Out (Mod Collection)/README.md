Unlike other collections, No Way Out offers three Sandbox settings options tailored to your experience level with Project Zomboid:
  
- **Survivor's Trial (Easy):** For new players. Multi-hit enabled, normal zombie count, zombies aren't that smart, normal loot. Additionally, more starting resources and abundant vehicles allow you to get familiar with the game's mechanics without overwhelming pressure.
- **Expert's Endurance (Intermediate):** For casual players. Multi-hit enabled, higher zombie count, zombies have default settings, less loot. Similar to vanilla "Apocalypse" mode, just a little harder. This setting provides a challenging yet fair balance, perfect for those with some experience.
- **Death's Embrace (Hard)** This is the original preset. Multi-hit disabled, even higher zombie count, zombies are much smarter, fewer vehicles, even less loot. Experienced players are going to enjoy this one; it feels like when you first started playing the game, facing an intense and rewarding challenge. Resources are scarce, and every decision matters.
