# Reactive World: Reactive Sound Events
What if sound events (meta events) were adaptable to your playstyle, weather, time of day and other variables? This mods makes that possible.

## Description:
Vanilla sound events lack a bit. After so many years, hearing the same dog bark or gunshot may be a bit boring. Besides, these are completly random. What if we could make these events have a reason? If it's night time, maybe someone is dying to the zombies right? Well, with this mod, that's happening and you'll hear it!

This mod is part of my [**mod collection**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969507692), which goal is to make the world as reactive to your actions and playstyle as possible. Check it out!.

## Mod Content:
**61** new sound events for you to listen. These events come in different types:
- **Animal Sound Events:** 4 new sounds (dogs, crows for now);
- **Gunfight Sound Events:** 11 new sounds, featuring survivors fighting zombies;
- **Human Gunfight Sound Events:** 11 new sounds, featuring survivors fighting other survivors;
- **Miscellaneous Sound Events:** 10 new sounds, featuring people doing stuff in the streets or at bases;
- **Screaming Sound Events:** 7 new sounds, featuring survivors screaming out of control (only god knows what things they ran into);
- **Vehicle Crash Sound Events:** 5 new sounds of vehicle accidents;
- **Weather Sound Events:** 8 new sounds (currently only covers thunderstorms and tropical storms);
- **Zombie Sound Events:** 5 new sounds (more frecuent at night).
These events have what I call **"preferences"**, these are moments where a type of sound event is more frecuent. These preferences are:
- **Weather:** Normal or extreme;
- **Time of day:** Day or night;
- **Player Playstyle:** Passive, aggresive or passive-aggresive:
    - A player is considered **passive** if he/she doesn't kill zombies for X days (customizable in Sandbox Settings);
    - A player is considered **aggresive** if he/she kills X zombies per day (customizable in Sandbox Settings).

## Help! This doesn't work:
- Make sure you are subscribed and **ENABLED** my mod to my mod;
- If you started a world with this mod enabled, and the mod updated, don't worry, it's **save compatible**.

## Planned Features:
- **Add** save compatibility with already created saves; **DONE**
- **Player Reactions:** Waking up, panic, stress;
- **Separate Weather Events:** Make it so weather events can happen on their own if certain conditions are met, without interfering the other events;
- **Event Radius:** Add an option for the player to decide how the mod should handle event radius (currently, you'll always hear the sound);
- **Add** more sound events (Gunfight, Zombies, Weather -blizzard-,);
- **Add** new types of sound events (currently none planned, feel free to post your suggestions);
- Adding **more preferences**: For example, world age;
- **Event Scenes:** For example, if a gunfight is triggered, generate a scene where a couple of survivors died and left some loot up for grabs;
