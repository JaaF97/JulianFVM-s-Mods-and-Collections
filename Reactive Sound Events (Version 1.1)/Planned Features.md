# Planned Features for Reactive Sound Events:

- **Add** save compatibility with already created saves; **DONE**
- **Player Reactions:** Waking up, panic, stress;
- **Separate Weather Events:** Make it so weather events can happen on their own if certain conditions are met, without interfering the other events;
- **Event Radius:** Add an option for the player to decide how the mod should handle event radius (currently, you'll always hear the sound);
- **Add** more sound events (Gunfight, Zombies, Weather -blizzard-,);
- **Add** new types of sound events (currently none planned, feel free to post your suggestions);
- Adding **more preferences**: For example, world age;
- **Event Scenes:** For example, if a gunfight is triggered, generate a scene where a couple of survivors died and left some loot up for grabs;
