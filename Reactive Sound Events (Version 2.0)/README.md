# Reactive World: Reactive Sound Events
What if sound events (meta events) were adaptable to your playstyle, weather, time of day and other variables? This mods makes that possible.

## Description:
Vanilla sound events lack a bit. After so many years, hearing the same dog bark or gunshot may be a bit boring. Besides, these are completly random. What if we could make these events have a reason? If it's night time, maybe someone is dying to the zombies right? Well, with this mod, that's happening and you'll hear it!

This mod is part of my [**mod collection**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969507692), which goal is to make the world as reactive to your actions and playstyle as possible. Check it out!.

## Mod Content:
**63** new sound events for you to listen. These events come in different types:
- **Animal Sound Events (6)**
- **Gunfight Sound Events (12):** Survivors fighting zombies or other survivors;
- **Gunshot Sound Events (11):** Survivors firing their gun;
- **Miscellaneous Sound Events (10):** People doing stuff in the streets or at bases;
- **Screaming Sound Events (7):** Survivors screaming out of control;
- **Vehicle Crash Sound Events (5):** Vehicle accidents;
- **Weather Sound Events (8)**
- **Zombie Sound Events (4):** More frecuent at night.
These events have what I call **"preferences"**, these are moments where a type of sound event is more frecuent. These preferences are:
- **Weather:** Normal or extreme;
- **Time of day:** Day or night;
- **Player Playstyle:** Passive, aggresive or passive-aggresive;
- **World Age (NEW):** As the world evolves, certain events lose probability (and others get even more);
- **Player Location (NEW):** Depending where the player is, events lose or gain priority.

## Compatibility:
- Every mod is compatible (haven't found any incompatibilities);
- Other mods that add events (like Random Sound Events) are **COMPATIBLE**, and both work on their own, so tweak settings to avoid overlaps;
- **Works in SP only**;
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/JaaF97/Reactive-World-Mod-Collection)

## Help! This doesn't work:
- Make sure you are subscribed and **ENABLED** my mod to my mod;
- If you started a world with this mod enabled, and the mod updated, don't worry, it's **save compatible**.

## Planned Features:
- **Add** save compatibility with already created saves; **DONE**
- **Rework** sounds completely (normalize volume, remove unwated sounds); **DONE**
- **Separate Weather Events:** Make it so weather events can happen on their own if certain conditions are met, without interfering the other events; **DONE**
- **Player Reactions:** Waking up, panic; **DONE in 2.0**
- Adding **more preferences**; **DONE in 2.0**
- **WIP** **Event Scenes:** For example, if a gunfight is triggered, generate a scene where a couple of survivors died and left some loot up for grabs; **WIP**
